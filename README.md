Home:
 - Given a surname, pick a random name to go in front of it. Do this as much as you like.
 - For any name, pull up popularity stats for it (rank, total count, etc)
 - Might also show the gender breakdown of a name


For any given name, I want to know:

 - How popular has it been over the years? (column chart)
 - When was it most popular? (text)
 - How will it sound with my last name? (pairing)
 - What's the gender balance? Is it more often a boy's or girl's name? (pie or divided box)
 - What names are similar? (this is hard)
